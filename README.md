# Google-Stock-Prediction_Using_Recurrent-Neural-Network_RNN_LSTM
# Instructions:
Here are the bold headings with their descriptions:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Importing necessary libraries.
   - Importing the training set.
   - Feature scaling using MinMaxScaler.
   - Creating a data structure with 60 timesteps and 1 output.
   - Reshaping the data.

2. **Building and Training the RNN**:
   - Importing Keras libraries and packages.
   - Initializing the RNN model.
   - Adding LSTM layers with dropout regularization.
   - Compiling the RNN model.
   - Fitting the RNN to the training set.

3. **Making Predictions and Visualizing Results**:
   - Getting the real stock price of 2017.
   - Getting the predicted stock price of 2017.
   - Visualizing the results with a plot showing real and predicted Google stock prices over time.
